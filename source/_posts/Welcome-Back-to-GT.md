### You There!

Welcome back to another year at Georgia Tech! Hopefully you're settled in with the courseload and ready to get back into the saddle with IEEE.

We've got some exciting plans for this upcoming year, so be sure to sign up for the [newsletter](http://gt-ieee.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a42ec30139b77172f44401aa5&id=a4ddfb6da0)! Also like us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gtieee?fref=photo) if email's not really your style.

We'll be kicking off the year with tech talks, resume workshops, new projects from IEEE [Innovation](../innovation) and [Hardware](../hardware) teams, online [Profiles](../profiles) for all you lovely members that are always dedicated to IEEE, and of course, continuing our [tutoring](../tutoring) services again as the year begins.

Please don't forget to pay your annual dues {% emoji bowtie 35 emoji %}
