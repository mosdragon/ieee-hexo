### You There!

Welcome back to another year at Georgia Tech! Back to the good old days of surviving off of Starbucks and Ramen!

We've got some exciting plans for this upcoming year, so be sure to sign up for the [newsletter](http://gt-ieee.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a42ec30139b77172f44401aa5&id=a4ddfb6da0)!

This year, we'll be working on a fully-electric Ramblin' Wreck, habing solid new projects churning out of the IEEE [Innovation](../innovation) and [Hardware](../hardware) teams, creating online [Profiles](../profiles) for all you lovely members that are always dedicated to IEEE, and of course, continuing our [tutoring](../tutoring) services again as the year begins.

Please don't forget to pay your annual dues {% emoji bowtie 35 emoji %}
