##BUILD ALL THE THINGS



The purpose of the Innovation Team is to provide students with little to no practical project experience the opportunity to build hardware, software, and robotics project from the ground up.

The team is made up of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduates, and phd students who have a passion for working on a team to learn and develop a product from conception of idea, to prototyping, to development, to marketing and demonstration to researchers and corporate representatives.

The IEEE Innovation Team is open to anyone of any skill level with an interest in hardware and software projects that could lead into  entrepreneurial opportunities.  If microcontrollers, quadrocopters, kinect hacks, and the Oculus Rift peak your interest at all, the Innovation Team is the perfect fit for you!

As a team, we hold workshop sessions to learn how to work with Arduino microcontrollers, surface-mount electronics components, PCB design software, Android development kits to get members psyched about the awesome tech we have and to allow them to come up with projects they want to work on.

Members are free to work on any project they want to in any capacity they can. We encourage everyone to stick through a project to the end and to even try entering for the InVenture Prize with it.

Students of ALL MAJORS and ALL EXPERIENCE LEVELS are welcome to join us and contribute their awesome ideas!

Feel free to contact our Team Captains for suggestions and questions:
