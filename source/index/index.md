Welcome to Georgia Tech’s student branch of the __Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers__. We’ve completely redesigned our site for the 2014-2015 school year to provide the best possible insight into all of our IEEE events,  including our hardware, software, and innovation team meeetings.

We also want to highlight some of our most active members and demonstrate some of the projects they have worked on to open new career opportunities for them.
