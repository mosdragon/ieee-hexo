##WE BUILD ROBOTS

The IEEE Hardware Team is open to anyone of any skill level with an interest in hardware and software.  If robotics, industry-standard software, and hardware projects of any kind intrigue you, the Hardware team is the perfect fit for you!

Throughout the year, we continually build and design a functional robot to compete with at the annual IEEE’s SoutheastCon Student Hardware Competition. The competition allows us to establish goals for ourselves so we can facilitate learning and direct workshops for specific applications.

Check out our [Wiki](http://ieee-hardware.gatech.edu/wiki/Main_Page) if you’re interested in seeing how our projects have turned out so far.

Feel free to contact our Team Captain for suggestions and questions:
